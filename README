This is an implementation of the JSON Schema specification (see:
http://www.json-schema.org/). Most implementations today are written in
JavaScript, but this one is pure Java. This allows pure server side JSON schema
validation if this is what you are looking for.

This README is very far from being complete, so the best you can do is go to the
Github's project page at:

https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator

In particular, have an eye on the Wiki, it is pretty much (with the generated
Javadoc) the reference documentation at the moment.
