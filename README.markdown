## Introduction

<p>This is an implementation of the [JSON Schema specification](http://www.json-schema.org)
written in pure Java. This allows pure server side JSON schema validation if
this is what you are looking for.

<p>The draft helping as a reference is, at the moment, draft version 3, which can
be found [here](http://json-schema.org/draft-03/schema") (version 4 is around
the corner, for some defintion of "corner" -- understand, days, or a few weeks).

<p><b>Version 0.1.1 is out</b>: see [here]
(https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator/wiki/Version-0.1)
for a list of features. For a detailed discussion of the implementation, see
