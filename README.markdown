<p>This is an implementation of the [JSON Schema specification](http://www.json-schema.org)
written in pure Java. This allows pure server side JSON schema validation if
this is what you are looking for.

<p>The draft serving as a reference is, at the moment, draft version 3, which can
be found [here](http://json-schema.org/draft-03/schema") (version 4 is around
the corner, for some defintion of "corner" -- understand, days,
or a few weeks). This implementation has <b>full</b> support for instance
validation using draft v3, and can be extended to support draft v4 easily.

<p><b>Version 0.3 is out</b>: see [here]
(https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator/wiki/ChangeLog)
for a list of features. Among others, it performs <b>more than 25 times better
than the previous version</b>.

<p>For a detailed discussion of the implementation, see
[here](https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator/wiki/Status). For a list of
planned features for next versions, see
[here](https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator/wiki/Roadmap).
