/**
 * Format validators
 *
 * <p>This package contains all individual validators for the {@code format}
 * keyword.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>While the very existence of this keyword, and its validation purpose,
 * is currently being discussed, this package provides them for all existing
 * format specifications as of draft v3. They are indeed very useful for
 * validation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The only really doubtful valildators here are the CSS related ones
 * ({@code color} and {@code style}): this is because I could not find a
 * worthy library on maven...</p>
