A JSON Schema validator implementation in Java which aims for correctness and
performance, in that order

<h1>What this is</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>This implementation is meant to be purely server-side if Java is your
language of choice. You may, <b>or may not</b>, use it in your Java Web
application; this library has no dependencies on anything Web-related.</p>

<h2>Strong points</h2>

<p>This library has three main characteristics which make it stand apart from
other existing implementations. While some other libraries also bear one or two
of the below characteristics, none can pretend to all three of them:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Correctness</b>&nbsp;It is currently the only library in existence to
    accurately validate numeric JSON instances of arbitraty length/precision; it
    also accurately uses an ECMA 262 regular expression engine to validate
    patterns (JavaScript libraries all do, of course, but then the JavaScript
    standard requires it);</li>
    <li><b>Raw speed</b>&nbsp;Downloaded schemas are cached, syntax validation
    results are cached, validators are cached. All of them can therefore be
    reused each time you have to validate data against a same schema.</li>
    <li><b>Fully thread safe</b>&nbsp;All schema object instances are immutable,
    therefore thread safe. You can use the same instance in several threads in
    parallel and validate as much data as you want.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Sample usage</h1>

<h2>Create a {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.JsonSchemaFactory}</h2>

<p>You cannot instantiate one directly, you have to go through its included
<tt>Builder</tt> class for that. This is by design: it allows to freeze the
schema generation context. Here is the most simple way of building a factory
using default settings:</p>

<pre>
    // Build a schema factory with default settings
    final JsonSchemaFactory factory = new JsonSchemaFactory.Builder().build();
</pre>

<p>You can customize your factory in many ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>registering/unregistering keywords;</li>
    <li>registering/unregistering URI schemes.</li>
</ul>

<p>See below, and refer to the javadoc for more details.</p>

<h2>Register/create a schema</h2>

<p>The class for this is {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.JsonSchema}.
This is a three step process:</p>

<ul>
    <li>you need to get hold of your JSON Schema as a {@link
    com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode} (here, the {@link
    org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.util.JsonLoader} will probably be useful);</li>
    <li>you need to register this schema to the factory: this will create a
    {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.SchemaContainer};</li>
    <li>then you can create your {@link
    org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.JsonSchema} instance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sample code below shows how to create a {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.JsonSchema} from the v3 schema draft, bundled in
this library (<b>NOTE</b>: {@link java.io.IOException} not accounted for):</p>

<pre>
    final JsonNode rawSchema = JsonLoader.fromResource("/schema-draftv3.json");

    final SchemaContainer container = factory.registerSchema(rawSchema);

    final JsonSchema schema = factory.createSchema(container);
</pre>

<h2>Validate your data</h2>

<p>Currently, you must load the data to be validated as a {@link
com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode}. Here again, the {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.util.JsonLoader} class may help you.</p>

<p>One {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.JsonSchema} instance may validate
as many JSON documents as you want, in parallel: this class is inherently thread
safe. Sample code:</p>

<pre>
    // Here, instance is the data to validate

    final ValidationReport report = schema.validate(instance);

    // Validation is a success if the report is empty: test it as follows

    System.out.printf("Validation %s\n", report.isSuccess() ? "succeeded"
        : "failed");
</pre>

<h1>Customizing your schema factory</h1>

<p>First note that all customization is achieved via the associated builder:
once a factory is created, it cannot be modified.</p>

<h2>Adding a default URI namespace</h2>

<p>When resolving JSON References, relative URIs may be encountered. In this
case, they should be resolved against the parent schema's location. But it can
happen that the parent schema's location is empty: in this case, the URI will
not resolve. As a matter of fact, the class in charge of getting a JSON document
from an URI, {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.uri.URIManager}, will refuse to
get content from a relative URI.</p>

<p>To work around this problem, you have the ability to set a default namespace:
relative URIs will then be resolved with regards to that namespace. This can be
useful if, for instance, you perform offline validation.</p>

<p>One possible scenario is to have a set of schemas on the local filesystem,
and schemas refer to one another in a relative way. You can do:</p>

<pre>
    // Note the ending /, it is necessary!
    final JsonSchemaFactory factory = new JsonSchemaFactory.Builder()
        .setNamespace("file:///path/to/base/directory/").build();
</pre>

<h2>Registering/unregistering keywords</h2>

<p>For this, you need three elements:</p>

<ul>
    <li>the name for your new keyword;</li>
    <li>a {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.syntax.SyntaxChecker} instance;</li>
    <li>a {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.keyword.KeywordValidator}.</li>
</ul>

<p>The keyword validator needs to have one constructor taking a JsonNode as an
argument (<b>keyword validators are built by reflection</b> -- this is what
allows them to be cached). You can then register the keyword to your factory
like this:</p>

<pre>
    final Keyword myKeyword = Keyword.Builder.forName("mykeyword")
        .withSyntaxChecker(mySyntaxChecker)
        .withValidatorClass(MyKeywordValidator.class)
        .build();

    final JsonSchemaFactory.Builder builder = new JsonSchemaFactory.Builder();

    // Register your own keyword, and unregister "format"
    builder.registerKeyword(myKeyword).unregisterKeyword("format");

    // Build the factory
    final JsonSchemaFactory factory = builder.build();
</pre>

<p>See the links above for further documentation.</p>

<h2>Registering/unregistering URI schemes</h2>

<p>A JSON Schema locator is a URI, and this URI can be of any scheme. This
implementation has native support for the following schemes, which are
guaranteed to be implemented by any Java implementation: <tt>http</tt>,
<tt>ftp</tt>, <tt>file</tt> and <tt>jar</tt>. While <tt>https</tt> is also
guaranteed to be implemented, this implementation chooses not to offer support
for it, because of certificate matters, which can be quite cumbersome.</p>

<p>You can, if you wish, either override the existing supported schemes, or add
support for a new scheme, by implementing {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.uri.URIDownloader} and register it in your factory,
like this:</p>

<pre>
    final URIDownloader myDownloader = new URIDownloader()
    {
        &#64;Override
        public InputStream fetch(final URI source)
        {
            // your code here
        }
    };

    // Example of registering a new scheme and unregistering another one
    final JsonSchemaFactory factory = new JsonSchemaFactory.Builder()
        .registerScheme("myscheme", myDownloader)
        .unregisterScheme("ftp")
        .build();
</pre>

<h1>The core stuff: the validation process</h1>

<p>The validation process is a three step process:</p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>$ref</tt> resolution;</li>
    <li>schema syntax validation;</li>
    <li>instance validation (ie, validate your data).</li>
</ul>

<p>The core package for the validation process is {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.validator}. All instances of {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.JsonSchema} go through this process. As
mentioned in the introduction, some parts of this process are cached, and don't
need to be computed again.</p>

<h2><tt>$ref</tt> resolution</h2>

<p>This is a critically important part of the validation process. You may
encounter, during validation, what is called a <a
href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-02">JSON
Reference</a>. A JSON Reference is a JSON Object with one member named
<tt>$ref</tt>, and the value of this member is a text value which embodies a
URI. Implementations are required to follow JSON References until an actual
final content is reached (and this content may, or may not, be a valid JSON
Schema).</p>

<p>Now, more food for thought. Consider this schema:</p>

<pre>
    {
        "$ref": "some://where/else",
        "minimum": 3
    }
</pre>

<p>This is <b>still</b> a JSON Reference. Other schema keywords, such as
<tt>minimum</tt> in this example, should be <b>ignored</b>. And this is what
this implementation does.</p>

<p>The core class implementing JSON Reference resolution is {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.validator.RefResolverJsonValidator}.</p>

<h2>Schema syntax checking</h2>

<p>This is an equally important part of the validation process. One thing to
note about the previous step is that it will only check that JSON Reference
resolution ultimately leads to a JSON document, whatever that document is. Which
means it may not even be a JSON Object, therefore not a JSON Schema. This basic
check is done at that level.</p>

<p>The syntax validation process starts with a {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.validator.SyntaxJsonValidator}. This validators calls
upon a {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.syntax.SyntaxValidator} instance, which
checks that all keywords are syntactically correct using a series of {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.syntax.SyntaxChecker} objects.</p>

<p>The role of {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.syntax.SyntaxChecker} objects
in particular is very important: for a given keyword, a syntax checker ensures
that the value of this keyword is well formed. This is what allows the next step
in the process to be easier to implement.</p>

<p>Finally, please note that the results of syntax validation are cached: a
schema which has already been validated will not be validated again.</p>

<h2>Instance (aka data) validation</h2>

<p>This is the part which actually matters to end users: ensure that their data
is valid.</p>

<p>The process begins with an instance of {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.validator.InstanceJsonValidator}. It will query, via
the factory, a set of {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.keyword.KeywordValidator} instances. All of these
keyword validators will then be called in turn to validate the data.</p>

<p>Here also, the results of computing a set of keyword validators from a given
schema is cached.</p>

<h2>Object/array instance validation</h2>

<p>There is one more step to validation. The step above will only have validated
that the current "path" in the JSON instance will have been validated. However,
in the event where the instance is a so-called <i>container instance</i>, that
is it has children nodes, which is the case of objects and array, then a further
validation step is issued so that all children get validated.</p>

<p>The two classes responsible for this, {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.validator.ArrayJsonValidator} and {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.validator.ObjectJsonValidator}, take responsibility
from this point and will restart the validation process from scratch for each of
the instance children.</p>

<p>It should be noted that while array instance children only have to match
exactly one schema, object instance children may have to match several of them,
which does nothing to simplify matters...</p>
