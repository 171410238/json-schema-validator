A JSON Schema validator implementation in Java which aims for correctness and
performance, in that order

<h2>For the impatient...</h2>

<ul>
<li>load your JSON Schema and data using {@link
org.eel.kitchen.util.JsonLoader},</li>
<li>create a new instance of {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.JsonValidator},</li>
<li>validate!</li>
</ul>

<p>The API covers all validation aspects of <a
href="http://json-schema.org/draft-03/schema">the current draft</a>, and is also
extensible, see below.</p>

<h2>What is JSON Schema</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.json-schema.org">JSON Schema</a> can be viewed as the
equivalent of XML Schema for JSON documents. Its role is therefore to validate
any JSON input thrown at you so that it conform to a set of rules you
define.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of a schema:</p>

<pre>
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "minLength": 3
        },
        "surname": {
            "type": "string",
            "minLength": 3
        },
        "gender": {
            "enum": [ "male", "female" ]
        },
        "age": {
            "type": "integer",
            "minimum": 18
        }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false
}
</pre>

<p>And here is an example of document to validate (successfully in this
case):</p>

<pre>
{
    "name": "Doe",
    "surname: "John",
    "gender": "male",
    "age": 38
}
</pre>

<p>Here is a document which will not validate:</p>

<pre>
{
    "name": "Doe",
    "surname: "John",
    "gender": "martian",
    "age": 3,
    "color": "red"
}
</pre>

<p>The reasons are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <tt>age</tt> property is below the required minimum (18);</li>
<li>the <tt>gender</tt> property does not match any member of the
enumeration;</li>
<li>there is a supplementary property named <tt>color</tt>, but no additional
properties are allowed.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is only scratching the surface, JSON Schema allows much more:
referencing other schemas, validating all types of JSON elements (there are six
in total: array, object, string, number, integer, null), etc etc.</p>

<p>This API covers all the current JSON Schema specification, which means it can
handle much more complex schemas than the above (this includes detecting schema
versions and acting accordingly, fetching schemas from external sources etc).As
to documents to validate, you can feed it with anything you like... That is, as
long as it fits in memory! Unfortunately, the API cannot handle streams as input
-- yet. This is being thought on at the moment.</p>

<h2>Extending the API</h2>

<p>The API also offers the ability to extend the API by adding new keywords,
removing keywords or changing the meaning of keywords (the latter is very useful
if you wish to test a new meaning for an existing keyword).</p>

<p>For this, you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>write a new {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.syntax.SyntaxValidator},</li>
<li>write a new {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.keyword.KeywordValidator},</li>
<li>and registering it to the {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.JsonValidator} you instantiated (optionially
specifying the version of the schema you want to add this keyword to -- see the
API for details).</li>
</ul>

<h2>A brief overview of features</h2>

<ul>
<li>schema syntax checking and JSON document validation (with the ability to
skip schema syntax checking);
<li>validator/schema caching;</li>
<li>arbitrary length/precision number validation;</li>
<li>ECMA 262 regexes, as required by the draft (using Rhino);</li>
<li>ability to register URI handlers for any scheme (HTTP only natively);</li>
<li>complete <tt>$ref</tt> support, with loop detection;</li>
<li>automatic schema version detection;</li>
<li>ability to change the default schema version (currently draft v3 by
default);</li>
<li>ability to register/unregister keywords;</li>
<li>full report or fail-fast report modes.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you find a bug, or have a featyre request, please <a
href="https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator/issues">file an issue on
GitHub.</a></p>

<p>Happy validation!</p>
