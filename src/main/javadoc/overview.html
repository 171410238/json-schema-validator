A JSON Schema validator implementation in Java which aims for correctness and
performance, in that order

<h2>Sample usage</h2>

<ul>
    <li>create a {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.schema.JsonSchemaFactory};
    </li>
    <li>create a {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.schema.JsonSchema} using
        that factory;
    </li>
    <li>for each instance you wish to validate:
    <ul>
        <li>create a {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.ValidationContext};
        </li>
        <li>validate using the created schema.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> the API is very likely to change in the future! It will be
    stabilized once version 0.5.0 is reached.</p>
