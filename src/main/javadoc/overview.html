A JSON Schema validator implementation in Java which aims for correctness and
performance, in that order

<h1>Why</h1>

<p>This implementation is meant to be purely server-side if Java is your
language of choice. You may, or may not, use it in your Java Web application,
the library has no dependencies at all on anything Web-related.</p>

<p>The two main characteristics of this library are its correctness with regards
to the schema specification, and its raw speed. Correctness in that, for
instance, it uses ECMA 262 for regexes and can validate numeric instances of
arbitrary length and/or precision. No other existing JSON Schema implementation
can do both of the latter points, and I can pretty much guarantee that no other
library is faster than this one.  If you find a counter example, I'd be glad to
hear of it!</p>

<h1>Sample usage</h1>

<h2>Create a {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.JsonSchemaFactory}</h2>

<p>You cannot instantiate one directly, you have to go through its included
<tt>Builder</tt> class for that. This is by design: it allows to freeze the
schema generation context. Sample code:
</p>

<pre>
    final JsonSchemaFactory.Builder builder = new JsonSchemaFactory.Builder();

    // You can customize the context, see below

    final JsonSchemaFactory schemaFactory = builder.build();

    // Shortcut to create a factory with the default settings:

    final JsonSchemaFactory schemaFactory
        = new JsonSchemaFactory.Builder().build();
</pre>

<p>You can customize your factory, as shown below.</p>

<h2>Register/create a schema</h2>

<p>The class for this is {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.JsonSchema}.
This is a three step process.</p>

<p>First of all, you need to grab your JSON Schema as a {@link
com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode}. For this, you may want to have a look
at the {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.util.JsonLoader} class.  Then, you need
to register this schema. This will create a {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.SchemaContainer} object.  Finally, create a
schema out of this container.</p>

<p>The sample code below shows how to create a validating schema out of the
current v3 schema draft, bundled in this library (<b>NOTE</b>: {@link
java.io.IOException} not accounted for):</p>

<pre>
    final JsonNode rawSchema = JsonLoader.fromResource("/schema-draftv3.json");

    final SchemaContainer container = factory.registerSchema(rawSchema);

    final JsonSchema schema = factory.createSchema(container);
</pre>

<h2>Validate your data</h2>

<p>Currently, you must load the data to be validated as a {@link
com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode}. Here again, the {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.util.JsonLoader} class may help you.</p>

<p>One {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.JsonSchema} instance may validate
as many JSON documents as you want, in parallel: this class is inherently thread
safe. Sample code:</p>

<pre>
    // Here, instance is the data to validate

    final ValidationReport report = schema.validate(instance);

    // Validation is a success if the report is empty: test it as follows

    System.out.printf("Validation %s\n", report.isSuccess() ? "succeeded"
        : "failed");
</pre>

<h1>Customizing your schema factory</h1>

<p>First note that all customization is achieved via the associated builder:
once a factory is created, it cannot be modified.</p>

<h2>URIs and namespaces</h2>

<p>Only HTTP is supported natively as a URI scheme. You can however add custom
downloaders for other schemes. You can set a namespace to your factory: if you
do so, all URIs encountered in the validation process will be resolved against
that namespace.</p>

<p>Here is an example which adds a custom downloader for <tt>file:///</tt> URIs,
and sets a namespace:</p>

<pre>
    final URIDownloader fileDownloader = new URIDownloader(
    {
        \@Override
        public InputStream fetch(final URI source)
            throws IOException
        {
            return source.toURL().openStream();
        }
    });

    final JsonSchemaFactory factory = new JsonSchemaFactory.Builder()
        .addDownloader("file", fileDownloader)
        .setNamespace("file:///some/where/on/disk").build();
</pre>

<h2>Adding custom keywords</h2>

<p>For this, you need three elements:</p>

<ul>
    <li>the name for your new keyword;</li>
    <li>a {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.syntax.SyntaxChecker} instance;</li>
    <li>a {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.keyword.KeywordValidator}.</li>
</ul>

<p>The keyword validator needs to have one constructor taking a JsonNode as an
argument (keyword validators are built by reflection). You can then add the
keyword to your factory like this:
</p>

<pre>
    final SyntaxChecker mySyntaxChecker = ...;

    final Keyword myKeyword = Keyword.Builder.forName("mykeyword")
        .withSyntaxChecker(mySyntaxChecker)
        .withValidatorClass(MyKeywordValidator.class)
        .build();

    final JsonSchemaFactory factory = new JsonSchemaFactory.Builder()
        .addKeyword(myKeyword).build();
</pre>
</body>
</html>
