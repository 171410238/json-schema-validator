A JSON Schema validator implementation in Java which aims for correctness and
performance, in that order

<p><a href="http://www.json-schema.org">JSON Schema</a> can be viewed as the
    equivalent of XML Schema for JSON documents. Its role is therefore to
    validate any JSON input thrown at you so that it conform to a set of rules
    you define.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>
<pre>
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "minLength": 3
        },
        "surname": {
            "type": "string",
            "minLength": 3
        },
        "gender": {
            "enum": [ "male", "female" ]
        },
        "age": {
            "type": "integer",
            "minimum": 18
        }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false
}
</pre>

<p>This API allows you to validate JSON documents using schemas like the
    above, and even much more complex ones. It is only limited in its input
    by the fact that it cannot accept streams as inputs -- yet. It loads all
    the JSON document to validate in memory. Other than that, it covers the
    <a href="http://json-schema.org/draft-03/schema">current draft</a>
    completely.
</p>

<h2>Where to start</h2>

<p>The main entry point to this API is {@link
org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.JsonValidator}. Use {@link
org.eel.kitchen.util.JsonLoader} to load both your schemas and documents to
    validate.
